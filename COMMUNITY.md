# Governance

Projects under the MapLibre umbrella are run by a [meritocratic governance model](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/meritocraticgovernancemodel). The overall governance across the projects starts with a lazy/self-elected board and will be replaced by a board elected by contributors. **Deadline for implementing the electoral process is the Foss4G conference 2022** (the timespan before this deadline is referred to as the “initial phase”).
